General
=======
Hi!
I'm Lars and this is my little homepage.
I initally had a wordpress.com page that I made for school, but after mentioning it in an application, I wanted to customize it a bit.
That's when I discovered, that to change even a simple COLOR, I would need to pay.
So, here I am, using github pages as a replacement.

What's this site for?
=====================
It's meant as a little portfolio/about me site.
I will add information about my projects (only one is currently published, if you ignore scratch) here.

			<div class="box">
I'm Lars Lerchbacher,
a hobby programmer and student at a higher technical college.
I think the best terms to describe me would be:
	- computer freak
	- space nerd (huge Star Trek fan)
	- linux lover (<a href="gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> is just the best!)
I spend most of my time coding, but I also like to play games.
Normaly I spend more time on code than on games though (holidays are exceptions)

My other hobbies are floorball (if I have enough time, due to school I can't play regularly),
aviation (currently flight simulators, I'm thinking about doing a pilot's license sometime),
Linux ricing and computers in general, as well as playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends (I'm a beginner DM).

I am also kind of the server admin at home. 
I got a mini pc (that's not a nickname, that thing is labeled like that) from my uncle,
because he wanted to buy something even better. I set it up with proxmox ve, which he also used,
and now I've got some things running on our network:
	- a nextcloud server
	- a wireguard vpn, so we can access our stuff at home from anywhere and invite friends to play on our local game servers 
	- a git server, in case I can't/don't want to put projects on github (my unreal engine game for example) 
	- and some game servers for my brother, friends and me

My experiences
==============

I'm currently studying at a higher technical college for IT & smart production.
I've been programming for about six years now and have always been interested in programming and computers in general.
In this time, I tried out quite some stuff:
	- Scratch (normally I wouldn't list this, but I am quite proud of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1145946002/">this</a> project)
	- Python 3, I started with a childrens book I got in elementary school and learned more from the internet,so I already knew a lot when we started learning it in school
		- tkinter
		- sqlite3
		- flask
		- django (forgot everything again...)
	- Java (school)
	- SQLite (school)
	- javascript (school)
	- Visual Basic for Applications (school)
	- Unreal engine blueprints (I wanted to start a project before loosing interest in it, so I didn't want to learn C++, but I think I'll do that sometime)
	- small bits of C
	- and a very small bit of NASM assembly


Editors/IDEs
============
As for these, I've also used some different ones over time:
	- Python IDLE
	- Visual Studio Community
	- Visual Studio Code
	- InteliJ (only tried it out, we are going to use it in school next year, this year we have to use eclipse)

These are the ones I actively use:
	- NeoVim (absolute favourite, I hate to use anything else without a vim plugin)
	- Eclipse IDE for Java developers (school)
	- Notepadd++ (also school)

Operating Systems
=================
	- Windows 2000 Professional, it runs on the first laptop I ever used, my grandma got it from work when they didn't need it anymore, because it was too old.
		On this machine I initally learned to use MS office and it was also the computer, where I wanted to recreate Pokemon in Powerpoint, because I noticed,
		that you could move through the slides using the up and down arrow keys. I can still remember that moment 'till now, when I first wanted to know, how coding works.
	- Windows 10
	- Windows 11 (active, I use it for gaming, school and game development, because the engine(s) I use(d) are installed here)
	- Linux
		- Debian/Ubuntu run most of our servers
		- Linux Mint, my first contact with linux, only runs on my sisters laptop as Windows 10 support ended. Works as well as windows for her. 
			I occasionally have to do updates for her though.
		- Gentoo Linux, I first learned about it, when I asked my best friend, what Linux her laptop had running alongside windows.
			It's really the best linux for me personally. It install packages by compilign them from source (my school laptop uses a binary package host in addition to that)
			and it does not have any installer except yourself. You even have to configure and compile your own kernel. 
			For that, I mostly use defaults, because I am not that experienced witht the linux kernel's options.
			It runs on my main PC and my school laptop, dual booting with windows 11 on both
