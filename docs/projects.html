My projects
===========

This page includes all my published projects
I will give a short overview about them and link the
projects github/website for further information.
I hope that some of my projects will be useful for someone!

I hope to be able to publish more stuff in the future, but I am currently stuck
at updating my book database system.
Then I'll be able to work on the big stack of ideas, that I have
accumulated, again.

Lerchbacher Buecherdatenbank
============================

My first published project (except from scratch and my neovim config)
This is a book database system I made for my family.
It currently consists of a desktop application, though
I originally planed to create a website for searching it as well,
but I don't know when I will do that.
I started it several years ago and didn't work at it for a long time.
The first few versions are now complete and I am currently working at
integrating my families suggestions and fixing my old, slow and
idiotic code.

More information can be found <a href="https://github.com/LarsLerchbacher/Lerchbacher-Buecherdatenbank" target="_blank">here</a>.

3D Renderer in Scratch
======================

A simple 3d wireframe renderer in scratch using perspetive projection.
I made it out of boredom when I was ill and couldn't do anything
but ly in bed for a week. I know, I should have rested instead...
The project uses the draw pen extension of scratch to draw shapes
consisting of vertices defined in the 3 coordinate lists. They are
connected in the order defined in the 4th list. Adding a goto instruction
in the 4th list will cause the program to go to the new vertice without
drawing.

You can find the project <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1145946002/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This project was inspired by the youtuber Garbaj and his video
