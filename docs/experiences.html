Programming languages
=====================

I've been programming for about six years now and have always been interested in programming and computers in general.
In this time, I tried out quite some stuff:
	- Scratch (normally I wouldn't list this, but I am quite proud of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1145946002/" target="_blank">this</a> project)
	- Python 3, I started with a childrens book I got in elementary school and learned more from the internet,so I already knew a lot when we started learning it in school
		- tkinter
		- sqlite3
		- flask
		- django (forgot everything again...)
	- Java (school)
	- SQLite (school)
	- javascript (school)
	- Visual Basic for Applications (school)
	- Unreal engine blueprints (I wanted to start a project before loosing interest in it, so I didn't want to learn C++, but I think I'll do that sometime)
	- small bits of C
	- and a very small bit of NASM assembly

Editors and IDEs
================

As for these, I've also used some different ones over time:
	- Python IDLE
	- Visual Studio Community
	- Visual Studio Code
	- InteliJ (only tried it out, we are going to use it in school next year, this year we have to use Eclipse)

These are the ones I actively use:
	- NeoVim (absolute favourite, I hate to use anything else without a vim plugin)
	- Eclipse IDE for Java developers (school)
	- Notepadd++ (also school)

Operating Systems
=================

	- Windows 2000 Professional
		it runs on the first laptop I ever used
		On this machine I initally learned to use MS office 
	- Windows 10
		Used it for quite a while, but support for it has now ended
	- Windows 11
		I use it for gaming, school and game development, because the engines I use(d) are installed here
	- Linux
		- Debian runs most of our servers
		- I tried out Ubuntu, but I don't actively use it
		- Linux Mint, my first contact with linux, only runs on my sisters laptop as Windows 10 support ended. Works as well as windows for her. 
			I occasionally have to do updates for her though.
		- Gentoo Linux
			It's really the best linux for me personally. It install packages by compiling them from source 
			(my school laptop uses a binary package host in addition to that, to speed things up)
			and it does not have any installer except yourself. You even have to configure and compile your own kernel. 
			For that, I mostly use defaults, because I am not that experienced witht the linux kernel's options.
			It runs on my main PC and my school laptop, dual booting with windows 11 on both
