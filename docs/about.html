			<div class="box">
I'm Lars Lerchbacher,
a hobby programmer and student at a higher technical college.
I think the best terms to describe me would be:
	- computer freak
	- space nerd (huge Star Trek fan)
	- linux enthusiast (<a href="https://gentoo.org" target="_blank">Gentoo</a> is just the best!)
I spend most of my time coding, but I also like to play games.
Normally I spend (a lot) more time on code than on games though (holidays are exceptions)

			<div class="box">
My other hobbies are:
- floorball (if I have enough time, due to school I can't play regularly)
- aviation (currently flight simulators, I'm thinking about doing a pilot's license sometime)
- Linux ricing
- computers in general
- playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends (I'm a beginner DM)

I am also kind of the server admin at home. 
I got a mini pc (that's not a nickname, that thing is labeled like that) from my uncle,
because he wanted to buy something even better. I set it up with <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview" target="_blank">proxmox ve</a>, which he showed me,
and now I've got some containers running on our network:
	- a <a href="https://nextcloud.com" target="_blank">nextcloud</a> server
	- a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank">wireguard vpn</a>, so we can access our stuff at home from anywhere and invite friends to play on our local game servers 
	- a git server, in case I can't/don't want to put projects on github (my unreal engine game for example) 
	- and some game servers for my brother, friends and me
